# script-generated-models
this repository is for models that i created that are used for projects that i make.
by loading the code hosted on here, it will allow me to load models instead of having to use GetObjects() crap on them.

this is much more ideal to me because GetObjects may end up not working for me in some cases.

all of this code is written in Lua and others are free to use the models if they wish. each model will have their own documentation in their own proper folder.
